# 30 Day DevOps Challenge by Kailyn Enitan

This repository was made in order to complete the **DevOpsAllStarsChallenge**. 
The creators of the git repo's that each project is cloned from and based off of are [DeShae Lyda](https://www.linkedin.com/in/deshae-lyda/) and [Kathryn Jones](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kathrynhopejones/).

Each directory is dedicated to a different project that has been assigned in the challenge. For every project there is a link to the YouTube video detailing the assignment within the readme file for that respective challenge.

Instructions on how to set up and run each project is explained within each directory.
